""" Represents the prime counting function pi(n) = the number
  of prime numbers less than or equal to n.

  Algorithm Description:

  In sieve method, we remove all multiples of prime p
  except p itself.

  Let phi(i,j) be the number of integers 2 <= k <= i
  which remain after sieving from primes less than
  or equal to j.
  Clearly, pi(n) = phi(n, sqrt(n))

  If j is not a prime,
  phi(i,j) = phi(i, j - 1)

  if j is a prime,
  We remove all numbers(except j) whose
  smallest prime factor is j.

  Let x= j*a be such a number, where 2 <= a<= i / j
  Now, after sieving from primes <= j - 1,
  a must remain
  (because x, and hence a has no prime factor <= j - 1)
  Clearly, there are phi(i / j, j - 1) such a
  which remain on sieving from primes <= j - 1

  Now, if a is a prime less than equal to j - 1,
  x= j*a has smallest prime factor = a, and
  has already been removed(by sieving from a).
  So, we don't need to remove it again.
  (Note: there will be pi(j - 1) such x)

  Thus, number of x, that will be removed are:
  phi(i / j, j - 1) - phi(j - 1, j - 1)
  (Note that pi(j - 1) = phi(j - 1, j - 1))

  => phi(i,j) = phi(i, j - 1) - phi(i / j, j - 1) + phi(j - 1, j - 1)

  So,following recursion is used and implemented as dp:

  phi(a, b) = phi(a, b - 1), if b is not a prime
  phi(a, b) = phi(a, b-1)-phi(a / b, b-1) + phi(b-1, b-1), if b is prime

  Clearly a is always of the form floor(n / k),
  which can take at most 2*sqrt(n) values.
  Two arrays arr1,arr2 are maintained
  arr1[i] = phi(i, j),
  arr2[i] = phi(n // i, j)

  Finally the answer is arr2[1]
